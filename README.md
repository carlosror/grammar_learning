## Description
  This notebook uses **[SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html)**  to compare 
  the grammatical proficiency of English learners in the United States to that of learners in other 
  countries of the [Anglosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere). The [dataset](https://osf.io/pyb8s/) came from 
  three Boston-area professors who collected and analyzed data from more than 600,000 people who took 
  an [online English grammar quiz](http://web.archive.org/web/20180217125721/http://archive.gameswithwords.org/WhichEnglish/).
